# ðŸŽµ Python Simple Autotune

A minimal Python implementation of a real-time-ish **autotune** effect using pitch detection and pitch correction. This project was created to explore the fundamentals of pitch shifting, tuning quantization, and digital audio signal processing using Python and scientific libraries.

> ðŸŽ“ **Developed as a course project for Voice Processing**  
> Built to demonstrate core techniques in pitch tracking, frequency-domain transformations, and basic autotuning.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Fundamental frequency detection using autocorrelation
- âœ… Pitch shifting to the nearest note in a selected musical scale
- âœ… Audio loading and playback using `pydub` and `pyaudio`
- âœ… Simple GUI using `Tkinter` for scale selection and tuning control
- âœ… WAV file input/output support
- âœ… Customizable musical scales

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Load a WAV file (mono preferred).
2. Detect pitch using autocorrelation or spectral analysis.
3. Quantize pitch to the nearest semitone in a chosen musical scale.
4. Adjust the audio signal by shifting frequency.
5. Output corrected audio.

## ðŸŽ§ Notes
- Works best with clean, monophonic vocal recordings.
- Autotune is applied offline (not truly real-time).
- This is an educational prototype â€” for production use, consider DSP libraries in C++ or frameworks like `JUCE`.
